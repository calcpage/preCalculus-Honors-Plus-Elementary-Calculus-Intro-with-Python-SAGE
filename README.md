# preCalculus-Honors-with-Python-SAGE
I use a combination of TI Graphing Calculators and Comptuer Algebra Systems to teach preCalculus Honors (pre-req for AP Calc AB or BC).
We use the sample code in this repo with http://sagecell.sagemath.org and we also use the TI84C.
Included are sage files for AP Calculus AB. We still have to finish AP Calculus BC sample sage code.

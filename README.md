# preCalculus-Honors-with-Python-SAGE
I use a combination of TI Graphing Calculators and Comptuer Algebra Systems to teach preCalculus Honors (pre-req for AP Calc AB or BC).
We use the sample code in this repo with http://sagecell.sagemath.org and we also use the TI84C.
Included are sage files for AP Calculus AB. 
I have screencasts demoing this code on http://www.youtube.com/calcpage2009
Please see my blog for more info, http://shadowfaxrant.blogspot.com
We still have to finish AP Calculus BC sample sage code.
